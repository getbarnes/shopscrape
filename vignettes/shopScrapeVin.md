desctiption: This package is created for price analysis of shopping sites.The motivation behind it is the problems that shoppers face when looking at two different sites and wanting to easily compare the prices. In this package will be ways to compare prices in a data frame while also searching the table. Other functions includes webscrapping for price barplots, currency changes, and parsing numbers. This can be used for big shoppping events like black Friday or even better cyber Monday.In the future I would like to update the currency function to take in more currencies and update the functionality of the barplots.
